# Insertion-sort
 Imagine you are playing cards. Somebody is giving you cards one by one. When you are receiving card, you are planning to put them in a way so that the smaller one is on the left. This means you want to insert them in a sorted way.

Step 1: If the first card you are getting is 5. Just hold the card in your hand. 

Step 2: If the second card is 2, you want to put it before 5 so that the two cards you have are sorted. When you are putting the card with number 2 at the left, you are changing the position of the card 5 from first position to second position. First position becomes available and you put 2 there.

Step 3: If the third card is 4. you will start from second position. In the second position, you have card 5 which is bigger than 4. Hence, you will move 5 to the third position. The next card to the left is 2 which is smaller than 4. Leave card 2 where it's at. Insert card 4 in the second position.

Step 4: You receive card 10. It is bigger than the previous card which is 5. Just add it at the last position.

Step 5: The next card is 7. You just move the position of the card 10 to the right and insert card 7.

Step 6: If the last card is 3. You will have to move 10 to the right as it is bigger than 3. Move the next card to the left it is 7 which is bigger than 3 Move it to the right move 5 & 4 to the right. Put the number 3 before 2 as 2 is smaller than 3.
