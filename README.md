# Insertion-sort
 Imagine you are playing cards. Somebody is giving you cards one by one. When you are receiving card, you are planning to put them in a way so that the smaller one is on the left. This means you want to insert them in a sorted way.

Step 1: If the first card you are getting is 5. Just hold the card in your hand. 

Step 2: If the second card is 2, you want to put it before 5 so that the two cards you have are sorted. When you are putting the card with number 2 at the left, you are changing the position of the card 5 from first position to second position. First position becomes available and you put 2 there.
