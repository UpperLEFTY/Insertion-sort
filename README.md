# Insertion-sort
 Imagine you are playing cards. Somebody is giving you cards one by one. When you are receiving card, you are planning to put them in a way so that the smaller one is on the left. This means you want to insert them in a sorted way.

Step 1: If the first card you are getting is 5. Just hold the card in your hand.
